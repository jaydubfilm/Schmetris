      We gotta get you in the air. Let's hit the training Simulator.

    text: Those funky looking coloured shapes are the salvage we need. Collect as
      many as you can.
  - title: Combo
    useWaitTime: 1
    waitTime: 4
    text: Nice! You upgraded some salvage by matching three bits in a row. The upgraded
      bit contains more material and takes up less space. Win-win!
  - title: Magnet
    useWaitTime: 1
    waitTime: 4
    text: Oops! You maxed out your magnetism! Right now your core can only carry
      6 bits at a time. With the right upgrades we could increase this limit, but
      there are other ways to save space.

    text: Good Job! You upgraded some salvage by matching three bitrs in row. The

    text: Don't be afraid of those pulsars. Bump into them and move your bits around
  - title: Pulsar-1
    useWaitTime: 1
    waitTime: 8
    text: It's all coming back to you! Pulsars are a great way to rearrange your
      bits or get rid of bits you don't want.
  - title: Fuel
    useWaitTime: 0
    waitTime: 0
    text: Uh-oh - Out of fuel! How did I fail to manage that resource? Better hope
      we find a red bit or two.
  - title: Fuel-1
    useWaitTime: 1
    waitTime: 6
    text: What are the chances? Fuel bits are automatically refined by your ship's
      core when you need it.
  - title: Fuel-2
    useWaitTime: 0
    waitTime: 0
    text: The other colourd bits need to be taken back to base before they can be
      refined... and - blah blah blah - too much tutorialing - not enough salvaging!
